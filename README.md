# File creation notes
 * SVG created using paticular corporate colour (e.g. watermelon)
 * Link to raw SVG file in MarkDown must be ammended with "?sanitize=true"
 * Use PowerShell (or other scripting) to create various corporate colour branding
 * Potentially use InkScape for conversion from SVG to PNG https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Convert-SVG-to-PNG-e759387c
